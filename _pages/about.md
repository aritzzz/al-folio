I'm Rajeev Verma, an aspiring researcher at the core of Theoretical Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Currently, I am playing with pixels as a Software Design Engineer at Tektronix India Video Team. I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology Patna (IIT Patna) in Aug 2019 with a major in Electrical Engineering. At IIT Patna, I was advised by [Dr. Asif Ekbal](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~asif/), [Dr. Sriparna Saha](https://www.iitp.ac.in/~sriparna/) and [Dr. Preetam Kumar](https://www.iitp.ac.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=254:dr-preetam-kumar&catid=25:the-project&Itemid=226). I also spent the summer of 2018 at NTU Singapore with Professor [Erik Cambria](https://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/Pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=CAMBRIA). I love the mathematics of machine learning.


Whenever I am not scratching my head to make sense of the mathematical equations, I read and, sometimes, write as well. I also maintain an Instagram Page, [Glazed Leaves](https://www.instagram.com/glazed_leaves/), of short writings. You can find the writings I am most proud of here. 

In my free time, I stare into empty space and imagine myself in all sorts of situations⁠—published a bestseller, shouting at the top of Cape of Good Hope, giving a spotlight talk at NeurIPS, visiting Lagos and Oceania, you name it.
