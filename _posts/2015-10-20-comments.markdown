### **Here's the Light** <br>
Here's the light <br>
Warring, it has come forth <br>
rusty armour shines <br>
ascends the fallen blade <br>
The ragged cape is in rage <br>
Cut to the chase, is this a dream? <br>
No, this is the dream <br>
The coup of the light <br>
Light, I was waiting for <br>

<hr>

### **They were us** <br>
Holding in the hand <br>
For just a split second <br>
Brought me reeling<br>
the invincible days<br>
of teas and hailstroms<br>
of walks and stories<br>
when picking the fronds<br>
and shouting on those roads were 'us'<br>
of flying and failing<br>
when pulling the strings<br>
and crying on those beds were 'us'<br>

The leaf in my room<br>
I couldn't take with me<br>
The memento of thousand memories<br>
I hope it's still there<br>
The way it has always been<br>
I left the door open<br>
Like it has always been<br>
But I am not returning back<br>
To the window sill<br>
Where the Ones<br>
laughing, living, and dreaming<br>
They were 'us'<br>

<hr>

### **Vigil** <br>
Deathly silence<br>
but the Angels never listen<br>
I keep the vigil<br>
Candles only are those who weep<br>
The leaves think it is divine<br>
Stars, moon, and the still sky<br>
They will now rejoice the apocalyptic fire<br>
Burning in this heavenly pyre are<br>
Poems—if they can read<br>
Oh the Zephyr<br>
Oh the Zephyr, make me the ember<br>
Maybe, this is how<br>
Words, Poems, and I will spring<br>
Rotating in this celestial orb<br>
I will spring<br>

<hr>

### **Perseus** <br>
Perched on the parapet<br>
Peeking the purple sky<br>
The gaze of the Perseus<br>
And the golden rain divine<br>
What lies beyond the pinnacle<br>
You see with an eye blind<br>
Heaven wings<br>
the shimmering spectacle<br>
Sunset leading to the sunrise<br>
God's son—the power within<br>
Wings and Sandals<br>
You too, you too can fly<br>
My love, you too can fly<br>
