##### Here's the Light <br>
Here's the light <br>
Warring, it has come forth <br>
rusty armour shines <br>
ascends the fallen blade <br>
The ragged cape is in rage <br>
Cut to the chase, is this a dream? <br>
No, this is the dream <br>
The coup of the light <br>
Light, I was waiting for <br>



##### Vigil <br>
Deathly silence<br>
but the Angels never listen<br>
I keep the vigil<br>
Candles only are those who weep<br>
The leaves think it is divine<br>
Stars, moon, and the still sky<br>
They will now rejoice the apocalyptic fire<br>
Burning in this heavenly pyre are<br>
Poemsâ€”if they can read<br>
Oh the Zephyr<br>
Oh the Zephyr, make me the ember<br>
Maybe, this is how<br>
Words, Poems, and I will spring<br>
Rotating in this celestial orb<br>
I will spring<br>
