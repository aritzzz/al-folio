description: Memories go very far even when people are near.

_Memories go very far even when people are near. In other room. Yet the distance mind travels to smile with them transcends the incredulous dimension of time. Past is solicitous. It embraces you. It makes the present tender so that when transcend time in future you feel, All is - was not lost. I have lived a sanguine life. Even when the one holding you by the shoulders canâ€™t trace you - You are loved. Time heals all - an illusion. The sun will rise to another fatuous morning and we will feel its warmth and light some other night in future - maybe day, in the darkness of the present. Time heals all._
